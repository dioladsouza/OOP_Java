The log files should give you all the information
you need.  It is intentional at some points to print the 
full plants so that you know the attribute of each plant.  
Also to run this program, you will need to go to project
structures and you will need to add a library.  The library
that you will need to add is the gluon javafx and then everything
will be able to load properly.
